I'm so glad they already renewed this because there are so many unanswered questions still. That's probably the only negative thing I have say about his show, that it didn't offer enough answers in the first season.

I think if people just be patient and allow the story to unfold, there will be an excellent pay-off. Lost was slow like this and it ultimately became a hit.

Granted there isn't much action in the first couple of episodes, but lots for character building and back story which is intriguing. It's hard to say too much without givng things away, but lots of twists and turns and shocks along the way. If you enjoy good storytelling with, despite comments to the contary, plenty of horror and shocks thrown in, this is highly recommended.\",\n",

It's a very clever show that has a lot of unknown and mystery to it. Every answer we get just leads to more questions and I'm worried that there's going to be more questions than answers but so far it has been a fun show to watch.

I also like the search for a way out with ongoing time. Nevertheless, I don't think it's a good thing that you apparently have to look back over several seasons to get an explanation, which is why I've become so sympathetic to short series. Unfortunately, the high expectations cannot be met throughout, and it then flattens out considerably in between. AND the actors all don't get an Oscar for it, sometimes kind of flat.

       " 'I was bored feeling like I had seen every movie and every show especially when it comes to the thriller and horror genre. When I saw this show was on EPIX I don\\'t know why but I thought, eh, low quality, lifetime type of show. Boy was I wrong. Similar feel to the show \"The Leftovers\". It\\'s a unique story that hasn\\'t been done before. The people standing outside of the windows truly gives you the creeps!! I also love the mystery aspect of how people show up in this weird little town. When I first started watching I thought wow a solid 8.5 show, but the reason I lowered the rating was due to the last episode. For some reason it got a little strange and confusing on the last episode. I\\'m super hopeful that this will continue to be a great series, but something tells me it will get weirder rather than better. I don\\'t see how they can put all the puzzle pieces together neatly, but hey! I may be underestimating! Can\\'t wait for season 2! I\\'ll be sure to update my review after more seasons are released to give the show a fair and accurate rating.',\n",

       " \"So the mega corps execs have been searching a long time to find the next Lost. All have failed , some came close and others just sank . So it is with great pleasure that I came across From quite probably the nearest and best thing since lost.So why you may well ask. Well it has Harold Perrineau for a start . Still not quite forgiven for his murder spree but none the less an older more wise and a character that gives the show some gravitas. The actors , even the kids , give excellent performances . The general feeling of malevolence through each episode is palpable. All the characters are well fleshed out with back stories , like Lost , available in flashbacks. Even the incidental music is a homage to Lost.The horror is horrific but done in a more Buffy style than Texas chain saw massacre.The mystery is both mysterioso and yet strangely familiar.If you haven's seen it , then its strap line should be , cross Lost , Wayward Pines and Buffy, Sprinkle a little bit of From Dusk till dawn and hey presto you have a very enjoyable experience.\",\n",

       " 'I had really low expectations for this but I\\'m a fan of dystopian series so I was intrigued to see what it was about. I don\\'t know if I\\'m impressed because I didn\\'t expect it to be any good or if it\\'s actually pretty decent so far. Sorta reminds me of wayward pines with an added gory touch. I think it\\'s well thought out but there are some things that I keep wondering about, like where\\'s the electricity coming from, or the livestock that Kenny says they don\\'t know comes from. Or the ghost zombie creatures origin, why only show up at night, where the totem things they hang are from; but the show just premiered and there\\'s still 7 episodes to go to explore that, I\\'m just hoping they don\\'t leave us with unnecessary plot holes or left out details because this looks like a potentially good show and I\\'m really excited for it. I don\\'t want it to end up like \"Yellowjackets\" which kept teasing in each episode that there was so much more to the story and the savagery it was gonna show, it was so stretched out yet at the end didn\\'t deliver any of that. Just like yellowjackets, everything in \"From\" is pretty decent, the production, acting, the storyline... hopefully it doesn\\'t hold back on the thriller aspect as well. I\\'ve seen people complain about the acting but I think it\\'s okay, sure no one\\'s winning an Emmy here but it\\'s not terrible. I just think the background characters are wayy too in the background, they could talk more to give us a better impression on the town. I don\\'t know if it\\'s based on a book but the name is not alluring enough, still, the show has great potential and if done right could last several seasons.Edit: Season 1 finale and what what I expect for seasons ahead.Alright the season finished not too long ago now. It ends with more questions than it answers but it\\'s a pretty decent season. We learn so much more of where they\\'re stranded but nothing to help us understand it better. Probably did it for the suspense, to have us eager for s2. I increased my rating from a 6, not the best show out there but it\\'s a good horror watch. It didn\\'t give out any answers but so much more is uncovered which leads to several possible storylines for the next season. If it follows this trajectory it\\'s gonna end up being a really amazing show. I don\\'t think they\\'ll end up finding their way home anytime soon, I think there\\'s too many stories left to tell from the small stranded community, and like many shows that had similar dilemmas, they\\'ll milk them and then several seasons later spin a story where they all escape or just open up to a bigger world. Like what happened with \"Westworld\" in S3 or \"The 100\" when they were stuck in that bunker or \"snowpiercer\" when they brought along Big Alice. Oh, how could I forget \"TWD\", probably wrote the book on that. They open up the scope of the series to allow for more stories to take place. But for now, \"From\" still has a lotta stories to tell in that small community and I think season two will take place in the same town, hopefully it\\'ll focus more on giving us a better idea of the creatures and everything else creepy about the show.',\n",

       " 'What I think I loved most is I did not have to wait 6 episodes to know what was the reason for hiding at night. They got me right at the gate and I was hooked. However, the reason I stayed for the entire season was the story development. As well as the oddity of it all. I mean, radio contact and \"she shouldn\\'t be digging that hole\".... I was shook!! We also crossed the bridge on \"did we survive the crash?\".... early on, there is a lot to this story. That is what makes it worth a 9, I wasn\\'t bored. Yes there are some cliched tropes, but as the story develops it all becomes awesomely engaging. I loved ... LOVED ... when everyone in unison within the first episode is like \"then you come to the tree\" that had me in goosebumps. I guess because I\\'ve road tripped and we\\'ve all at some point or another have come across a tree in the road. Then there\\'s \"Kevin\". This character is the cause of massive narrative and situational change and we have little to no idea who he is.Now that I write it down that whole story wasn\\'t dragged out and once you realize who is leaving flowers out and why, it gets right to it and again, another reason it\\'s great.... So I have just changed it to 10 stars because fair game, they didn\\'t waste extra episodes on developing Kevin and inducing anxiety as to when he would \"open a window\" they got right to it. So this is a 10 because the story doesn\\'t lag, it builds itself every episode story wise. There are some characters I want to slap around, but otherwise it is truly a great show. I mean the trees, the hole in the basement, the wall about, the lighthouse! ..... I cannot wait for April 23rd because this preview of episodes on AppleTV made me subscribe to MGM+ because the show was my entire weekend. Perfect.',\n",

I don't want to create a spoiler so I will just say I really truly hope that it doesn't turn out to be something lame like at the end of a particular Stephen King movie. The scary scenes really are creepy and well done, with the exception of when the two characters get out of a tent the next morning to discover certain material on the bushes and trees around them, which let the lead character to something straight out of the Stephen King novel that I was referencing, lol. Please have more imagination than that! And you don't have to have everybody swearing the f word including the teenager when yelling at her baby brother. It is pretty ridiculous and seems to knock the quality down a bit. Other than that they're doing a great job with this! Just don't blow it with a Stephen King ending, LOL.\",\n",

       " \"I don't typically read reviews before picking something to watch so I could have easily missed this and that would of been a shame. The second the RV kept finding the town and crashed, Wayward Pines crossed my mind. Although I have forgotten a lot of that show. From has definitely been a lot better than anything I was expecting. Even though there is horror and some gore, this show is so much more. It's very clever with a lot of unknown mystery to it. Every answer leads to more questions/ speculation. I am concerned there will be more questions than answers but so far it has been a fun show to watch. Plenty of mystery, thriller, some gore, some drama. I'm thoroughly pleased so far. It's definitely in my wheelhouse and it's great to see a TV show hitting those marks. I hope it continues to intrigue and doesn't have a cop-out ending. If they can manage that then excellent. For now, I'm definitely in for the ride.\",\n",

       " \"Early on it's always hard to tell, but sofar From seems to walk the line between being a supernatural mystery show and an outright horror show.Granted, I'm a pretty big fan of LOST (Including the ending, which is a hell of a lot better than it gets credit for.) which From shares *some* dna with. From, however, leans away from the global cast, exotic locations, and big punchy speeches of LOST, going much more for an intimate setting with a much more claustraphobic feel.I was particularly surprised by the character dialogue, which tends to feel almost improved, as characters stutter or stumble over words or use somewhat half-baked turns of phrase lend a lot of believability to most characters without going far enough to feel messy or wrong. It's that perfect level of mistake that helps sell the world as real.I'm excited to see how the series develops as we go on, and personally like having a new episode to check out every week(at lest for the next 6 or so weeks.)--Mid Season Update--\\nMysteries have evolved and expanded consistently, performances are still excellent. Writing can be clunky in certain scenes, but the performance and direction usually makes it work. The middle episodes of From have pulled away from the horror somewhat in favor of exploring the mystery and world.I would categorize as a must see for fans of horror and mystery TV.\",\n",

       " \"I noticed 1 rating comments getting downvoted into oblivion. Doesn't mean they're wrong, I too am trying to like this show because the overall concept is very interesting. But the execution feels way off. Just too many plot points defying logic and common sense.Given the consequences of opening a door or window at night, THINK would any of you who have children allow ANY of them to sleep alone in their own room? OR would any adult with a working brain choose to live in a big house with dozens of strangers, moody teenagers, and psychologically challenged individuals who do drugs, smoke weed, drink, and at the same time TRUST THAT NONE OF THEM will open a window or a door at night?There are ways to handle these type of plot points so that it makes sense but this is what happens with lazy writing. And I know, most characters in horrors make bad decisions (I've seen the Progressive commercial).. but still!?Aside from that the overall tone feels off. Wouldn't it be better to keep the tension level on HIGH, like it was at the end of episode 1? Way too often the towns people act like they're living normal progressive lives with a bright future, and not as though any mistake at night means you die a horrible death along with your friends and family. Most if not all of them should be on the verge of a mental break down!I can see the producers are trying to make a statement that people can endure and BE KIND in bad situations, but this is supposed to be HORROR, not a case study on humanity.\",\n",

       "\"I noticed 1 rating comments getting downvoted into oblivion. Doesn't mean they're wrong, I too am trying to like this show because the overall concept is very interesting. But the execution feels way off. Just too many plot points defying logic and common sense.Given the consequences of opening a door or window at night, THINK would any of you who have children allow ANY of them to sleep alone in their own room? OR would any adult with a working brain choose to live in a big house with dozens of strangers, moody teenagers, and psychologically challenged individuals who do drugs, smoke weed, drink, and at the same time TRUST THAT NONE OF THEM will open a window or a door at night?There are ways to handle these type of plot points so that it makes sense but this is what happens with lazy writing. And I know, most characters in horrors make bad decisions (I've seen the Progressive commercial).. but still!?Aside from that the overall tone feels off. Wouldn't it be better to keep the tension level on HIGH, like it was at the end of episode 1? Way too often the towns people act like they're living normal progressive lives with a bright future, and not as though any mistake at night means you die a horrible death along with your friends and family. Most if not all of them should be on the verge of a mental break down!I can see the producers are trying to make a statement that people can endure and BE KIND in bad situations, but this is supposed to be HORROR, not a case study on humanity.\""
